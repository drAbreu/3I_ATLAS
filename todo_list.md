1. Using the data from discovery... see if there would be any possibility at that point to actually intercept Jupiter
2. Check for earth interception. Whether that was possible at any time
3. Assume any possible acceleration. Any. Stiupidly high as it might be... Could that still send 3i atlas into jupiter interception? 
0. Maybe get jules code assistant to check this. --> Do plots separately
4. Do the data for the montecarlo simulation
5. Prepare the 2 blogposts to begin the series 
6. Move to the Wow Signal
7. Begin to do a Power point presentation for this series. Point by point.
8. Do the analysis. Also for Waow... Some calculations using GAIA and including the uncertainties of the original wow would be absolutely great ! ! !
9. Program this to publish posts every... 3 or 5 days
10. Check the order of the next posts. Each result should be presented as a blog post and a powerpoint presentation.
11. At some point I should use LLM to make a NLP analysis of the results of all the lies and manipulations of Loeb on this topic. If properly done.... Could even  become a short article / letter to nature
